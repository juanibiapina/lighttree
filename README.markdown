The NERDTree
=============

Introduction
------------

The NERDTree is a file system explorer for the Vim editor. Using this plugin,
users can visually browse complex directory hierarchies, quickly open files for
reading or editing, and perform basic file system operations.

This plugin can also be extended with custom mappings using a special API. The
details of this API and of other NERDTree features are described in the
included documentation.
